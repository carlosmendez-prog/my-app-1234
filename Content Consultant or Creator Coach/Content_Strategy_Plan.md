# Content Strategy Plan: The Tech-Savvy Gamer

## 1. Executive Summary: Stop Thinking, Start Doing

This document outlines a content strategy designed to leverage your passion for gaming and your interest in technology. It is a direct, actionable plan that addresses the challenges of content creation, particularly with ADHD, by creating a structured system that turns your focus into a strength.

**Your Niche:** You are not a "gaming influencer" or a "tech influencer." You are **The Tech-Savvy Gamer**. You are the trusted authority for gamers who want to get the most out of their hardware and software.

**Your Mission:** To provide clear, concise, and valuable content that helps gamers optimize their experience, make smart purchasing decisions, and understand the technology that powers their passion.

## 2. The "Tech vs. Gaming" Fallacy

The idea that you must choose between gaming and tech is a false dichotomy.

*   **Gaming:** Massively saturated. It's a red ocean of competition where discovery is difficult and monetization is a race to the bottom (low CPMs). Your passion is an asset, but it's not a business plan.
*   **Tech:** High barrier to entry, but a more valuable audience. Tech audiences are accustomed to high-value sponsorships and affiliate-driven content.

**The Synthesis:** By combining these two, you create a "blue ocean" for yourself. You are not competing with the mega-streamers; you are competing with tech channels that don't understand the gaming audience's specific needs. You will win because you are authentic to both worlds.

## 3. Content Pillars: Your Foundation for Consistency

To manage your ADHD and prevent burnout, we will focus on three core content pillars. This provides structure and predictability, which your brain craves.

1.  **Performance & Optimization:**
    *   **Concept:** Deep dives into game settings, driver updates, and hardware configurations to maximize performance. This is highly searchable "evergreen" content.
    *   **Examples:** "The Ultimate Baldur's Gate 3 Optimization Guide," "Nvidia vs. AMD: Best Drivers for Warzone," "Does RAM Speed *Actually* Matter for Gaming in 2025?"

2.  **Hardware for Gamers:**
    *   **Concept:** Reviews, comparisons, and buyer's guides for peripherals and components that matter to gamers. This is your primary monetization pillar through affiliate links.
    *   **Examples:** "The Best Gaming Mice Under $50," "Is a 4K 144Hz Monitor Worth It? The Real-World Impact," "Stop Wasting Money on 'Gaming' Headsets."

3.  **"The Tech-Savvy Playthrough":**
    *   **Concept:** Let's Play-style content, but with a unique twist. You play the latest games, but your commentary is focused on the technology. You are not just playing the game; you are analyzing it.
    *   **Examples:** A playthrough of a new AAA title where you discuss the graphics technology, the performance on your rig, and any bugs or technical issues you encounter. This satisfies your desire to play games while still providing unique, valuable content.

## 4. The ADHD-Friendly Workflow: Systemize Your Creativity

Your goal is to offload the "remembering" and "organizing" to a system, so your brain can focus on what it does best: being creative and engaging.

1.  **Idea Capture (The "Dopamine Dump"):**
    *   **Tool:** Obsidian.md or a simple notebook.
    *   **Process:** Any time you have an idea, no matter how small, write it down immediately. Don't filter, don't judge. Just get it out of your head.

2.  **Content Batching (The "Hyperfocus" Sessions):**
    *   **Tool:** A calendar (Google Calendar, etc.) and a project management tool (Trello, Notion).
    *   **Process:** You will schedule specific, time-blocked sessions for each stage of the content creation process. For example:
        *   **Mondays (4 hours):** Research and scripting for two videos.
        *   **Wednesdays (4 hours):** Film both videos.
        *   **Fridays (6 hours):** Edit one video.
        *   **Saturdays (6 hours):** Edit the second video.
    *   **Why this works:** Batching similar tasks together reduces the cognitive load of switching between different types of work. It allows you to get into a state of "flow" and be highly productive.

3.  **The "Done is Better Than Perfect" Principle:**
    *   Your dopamine drops after you release something because the "novelty" is gone. We will combat this by having the next video already in the pipeline.
    *   By the time you upload Friday's video, you have already filmed next week's. You are always one step ahead. This creates a sustainable loop of creation and release, preventing the post-release "crash."

## 5. Monetization Strategy: Value First, Money Second

1.  **Affiliate Marketing:**
    *   **Platform:** Amazon Associates, Kit.co.
    *   **Implementation:** Every hardware review video will have a corresponding Kit.co page with affiliate links to the products mentioned. This will be your primary income source to start.

2.  **Sponsorships (The Long-Term Goal):**
    *   You will not seek sponsorships initially. You will build an audience and a library of high-quality content.
    *   Once you have a consistent viewership (e.g., 1,000+ views per video), you can start reaching out to brands. Your niche makes you highly attractive to peripheral companies, component manufacturers, and even game developers.

## 6. Your First Steps: The 30-Day Action Plan

1.  **Week 1: Foundation**
    *   [ ] Set up your Trello board or Notion database for content planning.

2.  **Week 2: Production**

This is your plan. Read it, understand it, and then execute it. The only thing holding you back is inaction.
