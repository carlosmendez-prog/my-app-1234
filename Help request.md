With what should we start?

I am a passionate in terms of gaming, and the idea of being the GO-TO Channel for Gaming Content is something that I am very passionate about.
But I Do love the Idea of being a tech influencer, since is something i really enjoy and i think it can be a good way to make money.

so I really need to understand your chain of thought, and i want to start understanding why you think being a tech influencer is a good idea, and why being a gaming influencer is a bad idea.

we can be both, I don't have any problem with that, and I can make it happen. But since I have ADHD, I tend to forget everything and there is where you enter.
you are going to understand my situation, knowing that if I havy you, I can focus on creating content, and you will provide me with the tools to make it happen.

using my ADHD as a tool, not as a disadvantage, I've been able to create content for a long time, but when I release something, then my dopamine levels kicks out, and lose focus. I can't keep up with the quality of content I want to create.
