ok.
this is the first idea of the day.
Clearly I just dont know what to do right now
I followed the recommendation of getting a better microphone long time ago, and I need to create AT LEAST a video this week, but right now I feel so dopamine drained, that it was suposed to be a stream today, of the chapter 8 of the game i've been playing, but i did'nt.

because I work at a place that drain me and end my capacity to do things.
even building this vault took my dopamine, even tho it generated A LOT of dopamine, right now its 10:21 pm, maybe that is the reason im that tired and I should go to sleep.

but I want to do things, I created this LLM inside my vault, sincronyzed with github, and I can access it from anywhere, its awesome!!. feels like a superpower, to be able to manipulate my ideas and thoughts like that, and then have interesting answers on a TODO list, is awesome.
I can leave stupid ideas in here.

but I feel I can't get all time I'd like to the project bc of work, but is my only way of income, and it frustates me.
fucking hate that job, but I can't quit yet. not until this works.
I can simply not go to sleep and make an ugly video right now, or wait forever to do nothing, as always.

I need to setup my microphone also, to avoid background noise. it's starting to overwhelm me.
should I sleep?, should I quit?, should I not do anything and continue with my sad, ugly life?.
I dont care now, my brain is not procesing.
