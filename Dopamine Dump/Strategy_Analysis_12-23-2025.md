# Strategy Analysis: Dopamine Dump (12-23-2025)

## Executive Summary
**Diagnosis:** The user is currently in a "Novelty Seeking vs. Execution" loop. High-level planning (Rebranding, Market Research) is being used as "Productive Procrastination" to avoid the "Big Frog" task: **Starting the Stream.**
**Core Objective:** Convert the "Local AI" hyperfocus into immediate content to trigger Twitch Affiliate status.

## Phase 1: The Energy Audit
| Task | Novelty (1-10) | Spoons | Verdict |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Local AI Setup** | 10 | High | **Hyperfocus Target.** Use this energy. |
| **Twitch Affiliate** | 4 | Med | **The Goal.** Requires just 2 streams. |
| **RAM Market** | 6 | Low | **Trap.** "Research" = Procrastination. |
| **Rebranding** | - | High | **Ick.** Vague & paralyzing. Ignore for now. |
| **Camera Setup** | - | High | **Leak.** Perfectionism is blocking usage. |

## Phase 2: The Battle Plan

### 🚀 The Primary Mission: "Stream the Build"
**Objective:** Combine the *Desire* (Building Local AI) with the *Need* (Streaming) to bypass executive dysfunction.
*   **The Hack:** Do not build the AI off-camera. Turn the stream on *first*, then break the config live.
*   **The Pitch:** "Why I'm firing ChatGPT: Building a Local AI Brain on Linux."
*   **Outcome:** 1/2 Streams completed + Technical progress made.

### ⏳ The Secondary Mission: "Camera MVP"
**Objective:** Kill the perfectionism surrounding the DSLR integration.
*   **Step 1:** Buy/Find continuous power source (Dummy battery).
*   **Step 2:** Connect to OBS as a generic "Video Capture Device."
*   **Step 3:** Verify signal. **Do not color grade.**

### 📦 Batching "Input Mode"
*   **Rule:** Researching RAM prices or gaming news is restricted to 20-minute timed blocks.
*   **Output:** Must produce 1 written bullet point per session.

## Phase 3: Immediate Micro-Wins (Execute Today)
1.  **Schedule:** Set a calendar reminder for the "AI Setup Stream" (Tomorrow).
2.  **Asset:** Save **one** RAM price chart to a folder. Close the browser.
3.  **Environment:** Rename OBS Scene to "AI Lab" (Mental rebranding).
4.  **Physical:** Place the DSLR camera on the desk (visual cue).
