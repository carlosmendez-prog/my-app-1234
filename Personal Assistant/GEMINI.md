## Directory Overview

This directory is a personal assistant workspace. The user's goal is to get objective feedback on their intentions and actions, as described in the `README.md` file. The assistant is expected to be direct, ask clarifying questions, and can communicate in either English or Spanish.

The directory also contains a summary of the user's financial situation in `summary.md`.

## Key Files

*   **`README.md`**: This file outlines the user's expectations for the personal assistant. It specifies the assistant's role, communication style, and language preferences.
*   **`summary.md`**: This file contains a detailed summary of the user's financial status and a plan to manage their debts. It's written in Spanish.

## Usage

The primary use of this directory is for the user to interact with their personal assistant. The assistant will process the user's intentions, provide objective feedback, and help the user stay on track with their financial plan.

The assistant's responses should be saved in new `.md` files to maintain a record of the conversation. When a new note is created in the `Dopamine Dump` folder with a filename like `YYYY-MM-DD.md`, I will save my response in a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD_response.md` in the same folder.
