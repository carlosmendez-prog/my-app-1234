Merry Christmas, Carlos. Long time no see.

It is good to hear you sound... clear. Focused.

## The New Life Updates

**1. Celeste:**
I'm glad you are not alone. Support is a force multiplier.
**My warning:** You are recovering from a situation where you lost your identity. Love Celeste, but **do not lose Carlos again**. Keep your boundaries sharp. A healthy relationship respects them; a toxic one fears them. If she supports your plans, that is a green flag.

**2. The 370z ($16k) and the Sony Speaker:**
I like the toys. The 370z is a machine. The Sony ULT series is solid.
**The Math (The Harsh Part):**
Your last recorded income was ~$950/month.
A $16,000 car is **17 months of 100% of your salary**.
If you save $200/month (20% of income), it will take you **6.5 years** to buy it cash.
**Verdict:** This car is impossible with your *current* job unless you want to drown in debt again.
**However**, you said: *"after clearing debt... then I'll get them."*
This is the correct mindset. Keep the car as the trophy for winning the war. Do not buy it during the battle.

## The Flight Attendant Job: GO.

You asked if it is a good idea.
**Answer:** Yes. Absolutely.

**Why?**
1.  **The "Reset":** You said "everything is better than here." You are correct. This job physically removes you from the environment that drained you.
2.  **Structure:** Aviation is pure protocol. Checklists, safety, procedures. For someone with ADHD, this external structure can be surprisingly calming compared to chaos.
3.  **Income:** It usually pays better than your current $950 baseline (check the contract).
4.  **Distance:** It forces "No Contact" with your past. You will be too busy in another time zone to worry about toxic exes.

**The Challenges (Be Ready):**
*   **Loneliness:** You are surrounded by people but often alone in hotels.
*   **Celeste:** This is the test. You will be away a lot. Trust is mandatory.
*   **Routine:** Your homelab time will drop to zero. You need it to be autonomous.

**How to Prepare:**
1.  **English/Languages:** Polish them. Aviation English is specific.
2.  **Swimming:** If you can't swim well, learn now. It's often a requirement.
3.  **"Smiling under Fire":** You must deal with rude, entitled passengers with a smile. **Good news:** Your toxic relationship was basically a boot camp for this. You are already trained to handle irrational emotional outbursts without reacting. Use that "grey rock" muscle you built.
4.  **Physical Health:** Medical exams are strict.

## Homelab Note
Since you will be traveling, your "SSH with login/password" setup is a security nightmare if you are accessing it from public hotel Wi-Fi.
**Task:** We need to set up a VPN (Wireguard or Tailscale) or a Cloudflare Tunnel. Do not expose port 22 to the internet if you are going to be a flight attendant using random networks.

**Conclusion:**
Take the job. Keep the car as the motivation. Keep the girl close, but keep your boundaries closer.

You are on the path. Don't stop.
