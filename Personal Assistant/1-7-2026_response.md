**1. The "Alfredo" Reality Check**
Stop flattering yourself. Alfredo didn't "put his hand on the fire" because you are an indispensable genius. He put his reputation on the line for a liability. You have been late, sick, and uncommunicative. In the corporate world, that makes you a bad investment. You feel "important" because he saved you? Wrong. You should feel terrified. You are now responsible for *his* reputation. If you screw up one more time, you don't just lose your job; you make the one guy who vouched for you look like an idiot. You aren't "important"; you are on probation.

**2. The "Tool" and Your Ego**
You almost got fired for building a "note generator"? That tells me you are prioritizing your desire to be a "developer" over your actual contract: taking calls. You are trying to renovate the penthouse while the foundation is rotting. You ask, "Should I go harder?" The answer is **YES**, but not on your little side projects. Go harder on showing up on time, hitting your KPIs, and being boringly reliable. You don't get to innovate until you can prove you can do the baseline job without needing a rescue mission.

**3. The Home Front (Maria & Celeste)**
"Twins" is textbook manipulation. It’s the oldest trick in the desperate ex handbook to force contact. Keep her blocked. If it's real, a court order will find you; until then, it's noise. regarding Celeste: Be careful. You are shifting from a toxic dynamic to a dependent one. Saying she handles "everything I cannot handle" is weak. She is your partner, not your mother or your rehabilitation center. If you dump all your mental load on her, she will eventually break. Start carrying your own weight emotionally.

**Verdict:**
You are not "ungrateful" for wanting to leave; you are delusional for thinking you have the leverage to choose. You have no other offers. You are barely hanging onto this job. **Commit to the work.** Not because you love it, but because you need the money to clear your debt and you owe Alfredo a return on his risk. Head down, mouth shut, do the job.
