long time no talking.
hi, this is Carlos, with new updates.
I'm in love now, with the new girl. Celeste is her name.
and with a car, a 370z 40th Anniversary.
16k is the price.
and she likes it.
i want it as an objective for the new year.
I also want a Speaker, for home and trips. the ULT FIELD 7, Since I already have the ULT WEAR, I was expecting anything else than quality from them, and they do not disappoint, at all.
after clearing debt, getting emergency fund, and some savings for investing, then I'll get them.
I love having plans, so I can get inline with I REALLY want, and Celeste is actually going with it, and it makes it even better, Because I'm not alone anymore in my path.

merry Christmas.
