# Probing questions
- Did the customer authorize a shipping fee and not the follow-up charge?
- Does the customer recognize the merchant?
- Did the customer receive any merchandise?
- Did the customer cancel subscription with merchant?
- What was ordered initially for the shipping fee?
- Did the customer attempt to purchase something that resulted in no product, different merchant name, invalid merchant website, or no confirmation received?
- did the cardholder give out their account info over the phone to get in return a product or a service?

## $$Disclaimer$$
There is quite a bit of fraud claims that are processed for subscription charges that should actually be processed as a dispute. A lot of subscription charges, customers state is unauthorized and are automatically sent over to fraud without asking the above probing questions. Subscription charges are recurring charges. If the customer states that they authorized the shipping fee, then the remaining charges are possibly not fraudulent as the customer is aware of the merchant. If the customer received any merchandise it is recommended to return the merchandise to get a refund. If the customer did not receive merchandise yet, it is recommended to reach out to merchant to cancel services to stop anymore recurring charges.
