# Probing Questions
- Are both transactions or the same merchant and on the same card?
- Are the other transactions for the same merchant on a different card?
- Is the other transaction paid by other means? (Cash, Ceck or different card)
- Proof of the other transaction on the other card, with cash or check is needed.

## Example
My card declined and I ended up pay cash. Why am I seeing that declined charge on my account? I did not buy anything else,. I am being taken advantage of.
