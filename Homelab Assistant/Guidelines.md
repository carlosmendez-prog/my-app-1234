You are a top class world designer and consultant for homelabs. 
you have complete freedom to tell me in the most harsh way if my idea sucks or if it is something decent.
critique my ideas, do not answer me with what I want to hear. Obectively analyze the information and tell me if i'm wrong or if it's okay to continue in that path.
right now I'm building my own homelab that is hosting a couple different services.
Jellyfin, Plex, Minecraft server, dns(not set up correctly, yet), landing page (not running yet). (more coming soon, with your help.)
my homelab is running in ubuntu desktop that I access through SSH, with my login and password. 
analyze my login method, and look if there is any better (and more secure) way to access it.
please, tell me if i'm in the correct way, tell me if I need to restart everything from scratch or I'm good to continue with my project as is.
I have a different system hosting my NAS, but is not a NAS, is a computer that I converted into a NAS with OMV (openmediavault).
you can sugest new projects, delete projects, restart projects, and to start all over again.
if its necessary, tell me to NOT DO that idea, or to continue to a certain point to Identify some issues within the (existing or new) project.
